/**
 * Nifty BatchRenderBackend used to interface any graphics backend to the new BatchRenderDevice. This looks like the
 * existing RenderDevice interface but without all of the render methods.
 *
 * The idea of the BatchRenderDevice is to remove as much state changes as possible from rendering a Nifty scene. The
 * way this is done is through these mechanism:
 *
 * 1) A texture atlas is used to store all textures in a single large texture. The actual texture size is provided
 *    by the user but will usually be around 2048x2048 pixel. A BatchRenderBackend has to provide mechanism to create
 *    that texture and a way to load an image and put it at a given position into that big texture.
 *
 * 2) The only actual render data that Nifty will call this BatchRenderBackend with are textured quads with individual
 *    vertex colors. Nifty will provide the texture coordinates which will always be relative to the texture atlas
 *    created before. A BatchRenderBackend implementation should cache or send these quads to the GPU to be later
 *    rendered in a single draw call when Nifty calls the render() method of a BatchRenderBackend implementation.
 *
 * 3) The batch size, e.g. how many quads will fit into a single batch is decided by the BatchRenderBackend
 *    implementation. If a quad does not fit into the current batch the BatchRenderBackend implementation might create
 *    a new batch automatically.
 *
 * 4) Nifty will only start a new batch when the BlendMode changes.
