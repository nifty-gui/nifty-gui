## <a name="commit"></a> Git Commit Guidelines

**Note** These rules are loosely based on the [angular.js commit guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit)
but have been modified and simplified for the use in Nifty GUI.

Please read this carefully because we might reject pull requests that don't comply in the future. Don't be afraid though because it's short and simple, I promise :smile:

### Commit Message Format
Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The footer is optional.
The header has a special format that includes a **type** and a **subject**:

```
<type>: <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on github as well as in various git tools.

### Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

###Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

###Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
